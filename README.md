# Movie Recommendation System
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques.

# Overview
The Movie Recommendation System leverages user data to suggest movies that users are likely to enjoy, based on their preferences and behaviors. The system employs both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering algorithms, along with matrix factorization methods for generating accurate recommendations.

# Features
User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies by identifying users with similar preferences.
Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities between movies themselves.
Matrix Factorization: Utilizes techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings and recommend movies.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, transformation, and handling missing values to ensure robust recommendation generation.
Evaluation Metrics: Implements metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Precision-Recall to evaluate the performance of recommendation algorithms.
# Requirements
``` Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (for matrix factorization), matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation.git
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
Usage
# Data Preparation:

Prepare your movie rating dataset in CSV format with columns: user_id, movie_id, rating.
Generating Recommendations:

Run the main script to generate movie recommendations for a specific user:

python recommend.py --user_id <user_id>
Replace <user_id> with the ID of the user for whom you want to generate recommendations.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics like MSE or Precision-Recall.
# Example
To generate movie recommendations for user ID 123:


python recommend.py --user_id 123
